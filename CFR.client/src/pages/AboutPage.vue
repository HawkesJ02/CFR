        <p>On the medical side, we have 3 goals:
          o Professional medical services at the front
          o Establishing a backline-to-frontline logistics system that allows us to be self-sufficient and not depend on
          public logistics
          o Providing medical support to other regiments' operations on demand</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> We also take interest in:
          o Helping new players grasp the game mechanics
          o Building defenses and possibly maintaining a base
          o Logistics, not limited to medical needs
          o Various operations that allow us to experience non-medical aspects of the game

          We warmly welcome you into our community!</p>

      <h1>Colonial First Responders</h1>
      <h2><b>In Blood We Trust!</b></h2>

      <p>Founded on the 1st of January 2023 as a natural successor to the Colonial Medical Battalion, our regiment retains
        its focus on medical and support roles, while attempting to build a friendly and engaging community with the help
        of
        its experienced members and commanders.

        We consider ourselves to be a casual regiment - no playtime quotas, no strict command structure, no enforced
        medical
        duties. While all members are expected to attend medical duties to an extent, we mix it up with infantry,
        building,
        tanks and artillery from time to time, although these do not occur on a regular basis.
      </p>
