        <p>Founded on the 1st of January 2023 as a natural successor to the Colonial Medical Battalion, our regiment
          retains its focus on medical and support roles, while attempting to build a friendly and engaging community with
          the help of its experienced members and commanders. We consider ourselves to be a casual regiment - no playtime
          quotas, no strict command structure, no enforced medical duties. While all members are expected to attend
          medical duties to an extent, we mix it up with infantry, building, tanks and artillery from time to time,
          although these do not occur on a regular basis.

          <h3>Medical Objectives:</h3>
          <p>o Professional medical services at the front</p>
          <p>o Establishing a backline-to-frontline logistics system that allows us to be self-sufficient and not depend
            on
            public logistics</p>
          <p>o Providing medical support to other regiments' operations on demand</p>

        <h3>Other Objectives:</h3>
        <p>o Helping new players grasp the game mechanics</p>
        <p>o Building defenses and possibly maintaining a base, dependant on members</p>
        <p>o Logistics, not limited to medical needs</p>
        <p>o Various operations that allow us to experience non-medical aspects of the game</p>
